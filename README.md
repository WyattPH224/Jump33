Theme: Close in space far in time


We showed this theme through showing the goal of the game in the first screen, but making you play through the whole game to get to it. You are physically closer to the goal each time you fall, but farther away in time. 

Selectable Requirements attempted: 

  Data-driven experience progression (e.g. defined in a separate JSON/XML or other data file). Each level is stored in and loaded from a seperate json file.
